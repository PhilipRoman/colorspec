# ColorSpec

Colorspec is a small utility script to keep your color configurations
in a more readable format. See [manual](docs/colorspec.adoc) for more
information.

## Syntax

```
directory: bright yellow
executable: bold underlined red on green
pipes: bright green on default
*.txt: underline
```

## Dependencies

Colorspec requires Lua 5.2+ or LuaJit.
To build documentation, you will need Asciidoctor
(but you can simply read the source: [colorspec.adoc](docs/colorspec.adoc))
